Week 6

Project Overview
In this Week 6 assignment, we worked on data ingestion, requiring a larger data file exceeding 2GB. We utilized various libraries such as Pandas, Dask, Modin, and Ray. However, I encountered challenges while processing the data using Ray and Modin. Despite this, Dask performed better than Pandas. Following that, we created a YAML file and conducted validation for the column names, checking for special characters, white spaces, underscores, and other elements

Tools Used:
YAML and Python libraries: Dask

NB:
I created this repository because I faced difficulties pushing my code from my local machine, particularly due to a larger file, when it was combined with other code. Separating them into individual repositories has made the process smoother for me
